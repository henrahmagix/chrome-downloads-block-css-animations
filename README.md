Interestingly, omething is building up, something is leaking, because the mouse movements get slower and slower to perform ðŸ˜®ðŸ¤”

Works fine in an alpine container, which means either Chromium doesn't have the bug (and I don't know how to install a stable Chromium on macOS that isn't quarantined by macOS) or it truly is just my mac system that's borfed.
```sh
docker build -t chrome-downloads-block-css-animations . && \
docker run --rm -it chrome-downloads-block-css-animations
